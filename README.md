shmoo

Pre-Alpha

The Itch
--------

I needed to run multiple test cases, sweeping across many settings. The first
implementation was a stack of nested for-loops written in Perl. This is an
attempt to make the process more generic.
 
Example
-------

./shmoo.py filter=2 infreq=0.5:0.9:0.1 track=yes

Defaults can be defined in file 'shmoo.cfg'. This file shows syntax
examples and template format.
